# AWS Icons/Logos SVG Extractor
This script is designed to organize and rename SVG files in a specific directory structure, moving them into a single output directory and prepending the parent folder's name to each file.

# Getting Started

## Installing
Follow these steps to get your development environment running:

Clone the repository to your local machine or download the .ps1 file directly.
Navigate to the directory where you've placed the script.
Ensure that you have set the execution policy to allow scripts to run. This can be done by running PowerShell as an Administrator and executing the following command:

Set the execution policy to bypass for the current session
```Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process```

Modify the script if necessary to point to the correct directories where your SVG files are located.

## Usage

Here's a quick guide on how to use the PowerShell script.

```
# Navigate to the directory containing the script
cd path\to\your\script

# Run the script with the necessary permissions
.\YourScriptName.ps1
```

Replace `YourScriptName.ps1` with the actual name of your script. If there are any parameters or options, describe them here.
